This is a collection of .spec files suitable for building
the s6 supervision suite and related software, seen here.

This is by far the best init system I have seen, and it
deserves much more attention than systemd, upstart et al
are getting. I provide these packages for the people who
are turned off by the unusual build system and filesystem
layout.

DISCLAIMER: I have taken some packaging liberties that the
author would probably frown upon. If you have a problem
with the software, *please* ensure that it is not a result
of mis-packaging, by following the author's instructions
for manually installing the software, before you bother
him with bugs that aren't his fault.

These packages create static binaries linked against the
musl libc package built here. The musl and skalibs packages
are not split up into library and -devel packages, as is
RHEL custom. The resulting binaries are quite tiny.

The execline package is a special case; execline includes
several binaries with the same name as shell builtins
(exec, if, export). To avoid confusion and conflicts, these
binaries are stuffed in /usr/libexec/execline and 
/usr/bin/execline[b] are actually execlineb scripts that
modify PATH before calling the "real" binaries.
